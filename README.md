## Overview
![CFDWindLogo](https://windbench.net/system/files/cfdwind3.png)

**CFDWind3** is a tool developed at CENER for the simulation of atmospheric flows whose latests implementations are carried out under the framework of the [New European Wind Atlas project (NEWA)](http://www.neweuropeanwindatlas.eu/).
The current system is built under the open-source Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tool-kit [OpenFOAM version 2.4.0](https://openfoam.org/download/2-4-0-ubuntu/).

The model is designed to solve the unsteady Reynolds Navier-Stokes equations (URANS) for incompressible flows in which turbulence closure is achieved using eddy-viscosity theory and the modified (two-equation) k-Îµ closure scheme as proposed by Sogachev et al. (2012).
